Top models as of 30th August 2024 (see the full leaderboard [here](https://livebench.ai/)):

![image](assets/livebench-2024-08-30.png)

**Update 28th July 2024:** The first monthly update. We added 50 questions in a new spatial reasoning task, 28 additional coding generation questions, and 12 additional coding completion questions. In addition, we merged one of the optional dependencies in pyproject.toml into the main dependency stream to solve an issue experienced when using `gen_api_answer.py` without installing packages such as torch.

## Introduction

Introducing LiveBench: a benchmark for LLMs designed with test set contamination and objective evaluation in mind.

LiveBench has the following properties:

* LiveBench is designed to limit potential contamination by releasing new questions monthly, as well as having questions based on recently-released datasets, arXiv papers, news articles, and IMDb movie synopses.
* Each question has verifiable, objective ground-truth answers, allowing hard questions to be scored accurately and automatically, without the use of an LLM judge.
* LiveBench currently contains a set of 18 diverse tasks across 6 categories, and we will release new, harder tasks over time.

**We will evaluate your model!** Open an [issue](https://github.com/LiveBench/LiveBench/issues) or email us at [livebench.ai@gmail.com](mailto:livebench.ai@gmail.com)!

## Installation Quickstart

Tested on Python 3.10

To generate answers with API models (i.e. with gen_api_answer.py), conduct judgments, and show results:

```bash
cd LiveBench
pip install -e .
```

To do all of the above and also generate answers with local GPU inference on open source models (i.e. with gen_model_answer.py):
```bash
cd LiveBench
pip install -e .[flash_attn]
```

**Note about fschat**: The fschat package version on pip (i.e., [lmsys/fastchat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat)) is currently out of date, so we strongly recommend `pip uninstall fschat` before running the above, since it will then automatically install a more recent commit of fastchat.

Our repo is adapted from FastChat's excellent [llm_judge](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/llm_judge) module, and it also contains code from [LiveCodeBench](https://github.com/LiveCodeBench/LiveCodeBench) and [IFEval](https://github.com/Rohan2002/IFEval?tab=readme-ov-file).

## Usage

```bash
cd livebench
```

To generate model answers on LiveBench, run:
```bash
python gen_model_answer.py --model-path /path/to/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2/ --model-id Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 --dtype bfloat16 --bench-name live_bench
```

For API-based models, first set the appropriate key and then run the `gen_api_answer.py`. We currently support the following APIs: OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Cohere, and Gemini. The command to run all of LiveBench on an `api_model_name`, run this command. Note: In a Windows terminal you'd use `set` instead of `export`:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key>
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_key>
export MISTRAL_API_KEY=<your_key>
export CO_API_KEY=<your_key>
export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_key>
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=<your_key>
python gen_api_answer.py --model <api_model_name> --bench-name live_bench
```

To generate model answers with VLLM or other arbitrary APIs matching the OpenAI API format, run:
```bash
export LIVEBENCH_API_KEY=<your API key if needed. Usually not needed for VLLM>
python gen_api_answer.py --model <api_model_name> --bench-name live_bench --api-base <your endpoint. Often, for VLLM, this is http://localhost:8000/v1>
```

To score the model outputs:

```bash
python gen_ground_truth_judgment.py --bench-name live_bench
```

To show all the results:
```bash
python show_livebench_result.py
```

You may want to run these commands on just some models. To run any of the above python files (`gen_model_answer.py`, `gen_api_answer.py`, `gen_ground_truth_judgment`, or `show_livebench_result.py`) for specific models, use the following argument styles:
```bash
python gen_model_answer.py          --bench-name live_bench --model-path /path/to/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2/ --model-id Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 --dtype bfloat16 
python gen_api_answer.py            --bench-name live_bench --model gpt-4-turbo
python gen_ground_truth_judgment.py --bench-name live_bench --model-list Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 Llama-2-7b-chat-hf claude-3-opus-20240229
python show_livebench_result.py    --bench-name live_bench --model-list Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 Llama-2-7b-chat-hf claude-3-opus-20240229
```

Or, you may want to show results for a specific category or task of LiveBench by using the `--bench-name` argument. Here, we run `show_livebench_result.py` on just the `web_of_lies_v2` task: 
```bash
python show_livebench_result.py --bench-name live_bench/reasoning/web_of_lies_v2
```

By default, any of the above scripts will use all livebench questions so far released. None of the livebench questions have yet been officially deprecated/excluded. You can optionally specify the `--livebench-releases` arg to restrict the questions you use to added in specific releases.

To use all questions:
```bash
python gen_api_answer.py --bench-name live_bench --model gpt-4-turbo --livebench-releases 2024-07-26 2024-06-24
```

To use only the questions from the July 2024 update:
```bash
python gen_api_answer.py --bench-name live_bench --model gpt-4-turbo --livebench-releases 2024-07-26
```

To optionally download `question.jsonl` files (for inspection) and answer/judgment files from the leaderboard, use
```bash
python download_questions.py
python download_leaderboard.py
```

To use `question.jsonl` files instead of huggingface, set `--question-source jsonl` on `gen_api_answer.py`, `gen_model_answer.py`, and `gen_ground_truth_judgment.py`. This is also a useful feature if you want to tweak the question jsonls or experiment with your own questions.

## Data
The questions for each of the categories can be found below:
- [Reasoning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/livebench/reasoning)
- [Math](https://huggingface.co/datasets/livebench/math)
- [Coding](https://huggingface.co/datasets/livebench/coding)
- [Language](https://huggingface.co/datasets/livebench/language)
- [Data Analysis](https://huggingface.co/datasets/livebench/data_analysis)
- [Instruction Following](https://huggingface.co/datasets/livebench/instruction_following)

Also available are the [model answers](https://huggingface.co/datasets/livebench/model_answer) and the [model judgments](https://huggingface.co/datasets/livebench/model_judgment).

## Adding New Questions
If you want to create your own set of questions, or try out different prompts, etc, follow these steps:

- Create a `question.jsonl` file with the following path: `livebench/data/live_bench/<category>/<task>/question.jsonl`. For example, `livebench/data/reasoning/web_of_lies_new_prompt/question.jsonl`. Here is an example of the format for `question.jsonl` (it's the first few questions from [web_of_lies_v2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/livebench/reasoning)):

- Create a new scoring method in the `process_results` folder. If it is similar to an existing task, you can copy that task's scoring function. For example, `livebench/process_results/reasoning/web_of_lies_new_prompt/utils.py` can be a copy of the `web_of_lies_v2` scoring method.
- Add the scoring function to `gen_ground_truth_judgment.py` [here](https://github.com/LiveBench/LiveBench/blob/93e3a7d4fa5bb164ef4cb58f67683e4e54554af9/livebench/gen_ground_truth_judgment.py#L124).

- Run and score models using the `question-source jsonl` and specifying your task. For example: 
```bash 
python gen_api_answer.py --bench-name live_bench/reasoning/web_of_lies_new_prompt --model claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 --question-source jsonl
python gen_ground_truth_judgment.py --bench-name live_bench/reasoning/web_of_lies_new_prompt --question-source jsonl
python show_livebench_result.py --bench-name live_bench/reasoning/web_of_lies_new_prompt
```
